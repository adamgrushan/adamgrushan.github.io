							<strong>Unruh Associates</strong>
							<br>Vice President, Senior Advisor
							<br>Political Activism on Campus
							<br>January 2017 - May 2018
							<br><br>After the 2016 presidential election, the University of Southern California's campus held more energy politically than I had ever experienced in my two years as a student. In the months following I discussed politics more frequently with my friends, attended political events that were more heavily attended than ever, and participated in political science class discussions that were more heated than they had been before. 
							<br><br>The election of Donald Trump had fired people about politics on both sides of the aisle, but I did not believe there were many student organizations on campus that were seizing the opportunity to bring students interested in politics together. College Democrats and Republicans did so, but on only either side of the aisle. Other political organizations on campus hosted small events, but were not organizing on issues or giving students opportunities to apply their experiences on worthwhile projects alongside other students. And so, a team of six students and I founded, with the support of the Unruh Institute of Politics, Unruh Associates as a student organization in January 2017.
							<br><br>As Vice President of the new organization, I helped craft our mission to inspire students to fulfill their political and civic potential, foster the respectful exchange of political beliefs all over the political spectrum, and connect individuals across diverse communities who are interested in civic leadership and political engagement. Although we strove to meet those goals, our first semester in the spring of 2017 was a learning experience. We faced dwindling member support over the semester, hosted only a few small events, and had not made the connections on campus necessary to effect real change. It was evident we simply did not have enough experience.
							<br><br>However, we envisioned the opportunity to really start making an impact with a new academic school year in the fall of 2018. I built our <a href="http://unruhassociates.org/">new wesbite</a> in HTML/CSS with help from <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> and our designed our new logo set in Adobe Illustrator over the summer, and we planned, in the month leading up to school, an Unruh Associates open house where we would recruit students to apply and join. The event was a success, and we garnered lots of interest, applications for membership, and ideas for what Unruh Associates could be the coming year.
							<br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="unruh-images/pic02.jpg" alt="Associates at City Hall"/></span>
							This gave us a ton on momentum moving forward. That following semester, we grew the club by over 70 members, organized two roundtable discussions on nuclear proliferation and North Korea and environmental policy in California, hosted multiple mentorship events with the likes of former CNN Whitehouse Correspondent Jessica Yellin, USC Survey Director Jill Darling, and Los Angeles Schoolboard member Nick Melvoin. We visited political pollster Frank Luntz’s house for political debate, led USC’s national voter registration day efforts, and capped the semester off with a special downtown Los Angeles summit at City Hall that included a tour, an introduction from Los Angeles City Councilmember David Ryu, and three panels discussing careers in politics.
							<br><br><br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="unruh-images/pic04.png" alt="Associates at City Hall" class="center"/></span>
							In January 2018, our executive board oversaw the introduction of new leadership who continue to build the organization's mission and expand the group's impact on campus. Since their introduction, the club has continued to grow in membership, host ever more prominent individuals like Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris, and secure spots for our members at televised CNN Town Halls. The future is bright for the organization.
