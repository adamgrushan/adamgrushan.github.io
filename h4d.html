							<strong>Team Turnstone</strong>
							<br>Teammate, Co-founder
							<br>Empowering Digital Counter-messaging Teams to Challenge Radical Narratives
							<br>January 2018 - May 2018
							<br><br><a href="images/Turnstone-Presentation.pdf">Click to View: Showcase Presentation PDF</a>
							<br>Press: <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2018/05/hacking-for-defense/">USC Viterbi School</a>
							<br><br><br><a href="https://www.h4di.org/">Hacking for Defense</a> is a semester long, graduate school level course, taught at schools like Stanford University and the University of Southern California, which pairs governmental defense organizations working on tough problems with students willing to try and tackle those problems. Along the way, students are mentored on <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">lean start-up methodologies</a>, which gives students an approach to thinking about their problem and a method for iterating on a solution to that problem. Our team was composed of all undergraduates: Brian, a senior and our tech guy majoring in computer science, Ben, a junior studying design, engineering, and business at the Iovine and Young Academy, Mimi, the sophomore (but the most impressive of the bunch) who also studies at the Iovine and Young Academy, and I, the liberal arts major.
							<br><br> At the start of the semester, our team found ourselves in class full of graduate students, partnered with the State Department's Bureau of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) on a boil the ocean sort of problem: how might we identify, reach, and intervene in the lives of youth at risk of radicalization? With the help of our problem sponsor, class instructors, and 70 interviewed stakeholders involved in the CVE space, we ultimately narrowed our scope to a product that would empower digital countermessaging teams across the globe to challenge radical narratives online.
							<br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="h4d-images/pic03.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>
 							Our problem statement boiled down to online radicalization, and so we researched and learned that terrorist organizations like ISIS and white nationalist groups are some of the first groups to have secured territory online devoted to recruiting individuals to their cause. These groups are spreading propaganda to youth via online platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and more personalized recruitment messages through encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram. 
							<br><br><br><br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="h4d-images/pic04.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>And that is where we learned CVE comes in. It is an amalgamation of governmental and civilian initiatives that seek to counter and prevent violent extremism by addressing root causes. At the heart of root causes, we find family prevention and community initiatives like peace-building and religious tolerance workshops. Then, social workers, psychologists, law enforcement, religious leaders and academics make up interdisciplinary teams creating individualized intervention programs. And when extremist thought becomes extremist action, there are more reactionary responses like security intervention. Our CVE solution would need to focus somewhere in between all these efforts, but we were unsure where exactly.
							<br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="h4d-images/pic11.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>
 							The first academics and researchers we spoke to, like Dr. Erroll Southers at USC, directed us to places like the United States and Germany as potential beneficiaries of our solution, given the many white nationalist groups that have sprung up recently. We were passionate about this issue, however, after discussions with the State Department, we realized their focus was on international developing countries. So, by tracking key metrics that factored into a country’s need for an intervention program like internet penetration, impact of terrorism, and CVE funding, we narrowed our focus to the Philippines and Malaysia, two countries we believed were ripe for new CVE developments.
 							<br><br>The first week after scoping to these countries, we had no idea how to get in contact with folks on the ground, working on the issue. Ben and Mimi spent many a night cold-calling social workers, governmental organizations devoted to CVE, and religious leaders abroad, but no one wanted to talk us. 
							<br><br>When we finally did get in touch with a team working on this very issue in Southeast Asia, we learned the CVE space in these countries is not dominated by intervention teams, but by counter narrative teams. In developing countries, there are not enough resources to hire dozens of government officials, social workers, and community leaders to create an end-to-end intervention infrastructure program. Instead, an online scalable solution is more feasible.
 							<br><br>That is how we narrowed to counter messaging teams. These are the teams that craft alternate, positive narratives that theoretically reach youth who encounter terrorist narratives online. We learned the few countermessaging teams we spoke to in Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, followed a similar process in crafting these online narratives. First, the social media analyst finds terrorist messages online, screenshots those messages, and organizes according to helpful tags like language, narrative type, or grievance expressed. Those categorized screenshots are then shared with a narrative writer. The narrative writer then crafts a counternarrative, taken to the content producer who turns the message into digestible online content like a short video or popular meme. The content is pushed out onto social media platforms, and a social media marketer tracks the success of the narrative. It's a lengthy process that requires lots of collaborative work.
 							<span class="main"><img src="h4d-images/pic06.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>
 							<br><br>We realized there was a huge pain point at the first step of this process, where the social media analyst is forced to spend entire days screenshotting Twitter, Telegram, or Facebook posts and sorting them into literal desktop folders according to certain categories. If another team member want to study a certain message, the social media analyst must email the screenshot to that team member. It's a huge time sink for that one person, but also the entire team: the narrative write, content creator, and marketer must rely on the analyst's organization and emails to search through messages.
 							<span class="image left big"><img src="h4d-images/pic07.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span><br><br>Our solution, in a two-step process, would automate the manual scraping and categorization, in turn giving time back to the analyst to further analyze these messages. (1) Instead of screenshotting messages, Turnstone would pull from Twitter and Telegram’s APIs to web scrape and retrieve extremist content using similar methods to those outlined in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47874-6_3">Predicting Online Extremism, Content Adopters, and Interaction Reciprocity</a>. Then, the analyst would tag and categorize the messages using Turnstone’s interface, ultimately resulting in a tagged and recorded dataset of extremist messages. 
 							<br><br><br><br><br><span class="image left big"><img src="h4d-images/pic08.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>(2) Using some of those same natural language processing methods and the tagged database, we would create a machine learning algorithm that would sort and tag all the messages, fully automating the sorting of content. We learned that this sort of machine learning is possible by talking with Adam Badawy and Emilio Ferrara, the authors of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47874-6_3">The Rise of Jihadist Propaganda on Social Networks</a>. They confirmed it is theoretically possible, with a large enough data set, to teach natural language processing machines how to categorize and tag social media posts according to many of the tags countermessaging analysts use today.
							<br><br><br>The end result is a searchable database with an interface like the one below, where a countermessaging team of users could sort messages by location, time, platform, language, level of radicalization, narrative type, and type of grievance expressed – the same helpful categories that analysts’ use now. With a majority of their time freed up, analysts can now refocus on more complex analysis of terrorist narratives, and the entire team no longer relies on the analyst to easily search and make sense of extremist messaging online.
 							<br><br><span class="main"><img src="h4d-images/pic09.png" alt="team" class="center"/></span>
 							<br><br>And that's where our 15 weeks left us. Ultimately, we presented a proof of concept to our State Department sponsor and a host of defense industry professionals including Rt. Hon. General David Petraeus. There is still a lot to be done, but we hope our potential product and customer discovery highlighted to the State Department the importance of technological tools that can make countermessaging teams more productive. We are all also excited about the potential opportunities we have in civic and government tech down the road.
